# Web-APIs-Code-Quiz

The user is expected to click on a “start” button to start the quiz. This event triggers the 75 sec timer and answering a question wrong will result in a time deduction. When the time is up or when the quiz is finished (whichever event comes first) the user is given the option to log their initials and their resulted score. One can also view all stored high scores.
